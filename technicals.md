## Hardware
- Low power: 10W MAX TPU under load. Idle TPU should be a fraction of MAX, 1/10th or so.
- Portable: should fit in your hand.
- Simple to use/maintain/replace/clone/expand/modify (we'll see what else has to give to meet these).

### The box

Ideally an open architecture like OpenRISC/RISC-V but for now we'll settle for ARM:
