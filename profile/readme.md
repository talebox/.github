# Talebox - Draft-00_2022

Don't you just hate when everything is made unecessarily complicated by privatization + increasingly deterministic population control with the advent of big data analitics being used for profits. Me too...

So I present: A carefully picked stack of essential technology that's easy to understand, use, modify, and maintain.

For the nerds out there a shorter description would be: **A Private Cloud OS/Hardware/Management solution**. For which I have googled incessantly but found no easy answers. I'm still actively putting together my findings here.

A **replacement for services which give you inmessurable personal value without selling you in the process**. Services that you count on every day, like idk... a notes/whiteboard app, or perhaps saving family photos, files, projects. Or maybe an open source social media platform, or a git repository.

Services you know will be available even if your ISP decieded to suck that day, or a zombie outbreak happens. Because they should be **YOURS** to use whenever/wherever **YOU want**.

If anyone reading knows of a similar project please contact me and I'll happily mark this as a duplicate idea and refer to that project instead. 

But I absolutely know someone else has thought of this and companies could easily flip a switch and make this available, only problem is profits won't allow it, so we're left with reverse engineering of existing services to provide data ownership at a tangible cost to the consumer (which will always be orders of magnitude lower than the intangible costs of "free" services from private industries).

## So what exactly am I talking about?
I'm talking about a single board computer that's $50 to purchase. You can hold in the palm of your hand and power with a measily 10W or a small solar panel. Place anywhere in your home, pull up the browser/app, and take notes, save files, social media away locally or with other boxes/servers. Yes, it's "the cloud", yes it's not a cloud its just that little thing that fits on your hand answering questions and solving problems. Can you take ur box on your field trip? yes. Can you take this box to your bunker? yes. Can you eat spaguetti next to the thing that's organizing your life for you, and making u a better human being because of it, yes.

Yes that's possible, it's been for a decade now, it's just not ideal for you to know how simple, or cheap, it is. Yes it takes time for people like me to come up with and develop these ideas. But I'll account for that in my business model.

# Goals

1. Portable
   1. Small: fits in your hand.
   2. Low power: running as long as daylight is available to a square foot panel.
2. Simple
   1. To Use: Progressively finer controls depending on consumer skill level.
   2. Maintain: A [minimal web interface](https://github.com/talebox/.github/blob/master/technicals.md#web-management-interface)
   3. Replace/Clone: Optional backups to storage devices, or another box (somewhere else, maybe the cloud).
   4. Expand: Optional aditional expanded storage/processsing (swarm with sharding/parallellism).
   5. Modify: It's yours, if you have physical access to it, you can do as you wish. But data can be optionally encrypted at your discretion.
3. Useful, a fully-managed, albeit customizable, [offline service ecosystem](https://github.com/talebox/.github/blob/master/services.md).
