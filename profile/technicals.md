# Hardware
1. Small: 2x1x1 in max size.
2. Low power: 10W MAX under load. Idle should be <1W.

## Hardware

### Ideas
Ideally an open architecture like OpenRISC/RISC-V but for now we'll settle for ARM:

**SOC Brand**
- [Amlogic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amlogic)
- [Allwinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allwinner_Technology)
- [Rockchip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockchip)

**SBC Brand**
- [Pine 64](https://pine64.com/)
- [Libre Computer](https://libre.computer/)

**Boards**
- [PINE A64-LTS V2](https://pine64.com/product/pine-a64-lts/)
- [Beaglebone Green](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/seeed-technology-co-ltd/102010048/5965297)
- [Rapberry Pi 4B]()

### Develoment (a subset of [ideas](#ideas) to be implemented)

# Software
- Minimal boot time with an open source edge compute OS.

We need a swarm of cloud nodes provisioning our public services (ex website/os/online public management) + private user owned boxes

## Server
- Management Interface
